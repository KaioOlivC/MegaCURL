Musical artist

Akina Nakamori (中森 明菜, Nakamori Akina, born 13 July 1965) is a Japanese singer and actress. She is one of the most popular and best-selling artists in Japan.[1] Akina achieved national recognition after winning the 1981 season of the talent show Star Tanjō!. Her debut single "Slow Motion" was released to moderate success, peaking at number thirty on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart. Nakamori's popularity increased with the release of her follow-up single, "Shōjo A", which peaked at number five on the Oricon charts and sold over 390,000 copies. Her second album Variation became her first number-one on the Oricon Weekly Albums Chart, staying in that position for three weeks.

She made her acting debut in 1985 with an appearance in the Japanese romance movie Ai, Tabidachi. After an extended hiatus from 2010 to 2014, Akina released two compilation albums, All Time Best: Original and All Time Best: Utahime Cover, both of which were commercially successful.
Early life[edit]

Nakamori was born on 13 July 1965, in Ōta, Tokyo, the fifth child and third daughter of six brothers and sisters.[2] Her father Akio Nakamori[3] owned a meat shop.[4] Nakamori and her siblings were all named after their father, Akio, bearing the kanji 明 (aki) in their names.[5] Her mother named her "Akina", which means "a bright nanohana flower".[4] Her younger sister Akiho Nakamori [jp] was also an actress who died in 2019 at the age of 52.[3] Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Kiyose, Tokyo, where she grew up.[2]

Her mother, a fan of Hibari Misora, made her listen to Hibari's songs and taught her how to sing. Eventually, Nakamori began to dream of becoming a singer under the influence of her mother.[6]
Career[edit] 1982–1984[edit]

After Akina Nakamori won Star Tanjō! on her third attempt, she made her debut in 1982 with the single "Slow Motion."[7] Recorded in Los Angeles, the single was released on 1 May 1982 and sold 174,000 copies, reaching No. 30 on the Oricon charts. The second single, "Shōjo A" was nearly banned for its risque lyrics. This single fared better and peaked at No. 5, selling 396,000 copies. Her next single, a ballad titled "Second Love" proved to be her best-selling single. It debuted at No. 2 but reached No. 1 the following week, staying at the top for nine weeks. It sold 766,000 copies then, and to date has sold almost one million. In addition to the single releases, Nakamori also released two albums titled Prologue and Variation that year, which sold 453,000 and 743,000 copies respectively.

The following year, Nakamori released three singles, two studio albums, and her first best-of album. The singles were "½ no Shinwa", which sold 573,000 copies and debuted at #1, making it her best-selling single of that year; "Twilight (Yūgure Dayori)", released in May, which sold 430,000 copies and debuted at #2; and "Kinku", her last single of that year, which debuted at #1 and sold 511,000 copies. All three albums, Fantasy, New Akina Etranger and Best Akina Memoires hit No. 1. Nakamori made the first of her seven official performances on the NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen on 31 December 1983, the 34th edition of the show.

In 1984, Nakamori released "Kita Wing", which sold 614,000 copies and debuted at number 2 and remained at that position for 6 weeks. "Kita Wing" is also rumored to be Momoe Yamaguchi's favorite Nakamori Song. Yamaguchi is Nakamori's idol. Her next single "Southern Wind" brought her back to the number 1 spot, though it sold less than its predecessor at 544,000 copies. "Jukkai (1984)" proved to be another number 1 for her, selling 611,000 copies. The 9th single, "Kazari ja Nai no yo Namida wa" proved to be a turning point in Akina Nakamori's career as the song is considered difficult to sing with fast lyrics. It debuted at number 1 and sold 625,000 copies. Many in Japan cite this song and her 1986 single, "Desire (Jōnetsu)", as Nakamori's signature song. Her two album releases of that year, Anniversary and Possibility both fared well and hit No. 1.
1985–1986[edit]

Nakamori kicked off 1985 with "Meu amor é...," which debuted #1 with 631,000 copies sold ultimately and also winning Nakamori the Grand Prix award at the 27th Japan Record Awards. She became the youngest person at the time (20) to be given the award. Originally, the single was to be titled "Akaitori Nigeta" (The red bird flies away), but the producers felt that the lyrics were not Samba-ish enough. "Meu amor é..." was the result of the newly penned lyrics. "Akaitori Nigeta" was released as a 12-inch single instead, making the No.1 spot as well. It also contained the remixed b-side Babylon and sold 354,000 overall. She then released "Sand Beige (Sabaku e)" which sold 461,000 copies and debuted at number 1. Her next single, "Solitude" also debuted at number 1 and sold 336,000 copies.

She also released two albums in 1985. Firstly, Bitter and Sweet, which contained the album version of the earlier hit of "Kazari ja Nai no yo Namida wa" and "BABYLON." It sold 556,000 copies and debuted at number 1 again. Her next album, D404ME, only had a remix version of the hit single "Meu amor é..." among other new songs and sold 651,000 copies, debuting at number 1.

In 1986, Nakamori's first single of that year, "Desire (Jōnetsu)" marked a more mature style of singing and song choice. It was the theme song of the Pioneer Private commercial and was awarded the Grand Prix at the 28th Japan Record Awards in 1986. She became the youngest winner of two consecutive years. It sold 516,000 copies and debuted at number 1. Her next single "Gypsy Queen" was a calmer song than "Desire (Jōnetsu)" and sold 358,000 copies, debuting at number 1. The single "Fin" followed, and sold 318,000 copies, debuting at number 1.

To commemorate her first four years in the business, Nakamori released her first "BEST" album. It sold 766,000 copies and debuted at number 1. Nakamori then released Fushigi, a concept album with echoing singing and obscure musical arrangement. It was a shock for the mainly conservative Japanese public, and thus sold 464,000 copies, nearly 200,000 less than Crimson, an album composed in entirety by only women, which sold 601,000 copies. Both debuted at number 1, but Fushigi stayed at number 1 for only three weeks while Crimson topped the charts for four.[8]
1987–1989[edit]

In 1987, she released "Tango Noir," which sold 348,000 copies and debuted at number 1. Even though sales of singles were declining, "Tango Noir" still became the second best-selling single in 1987. Her next single was "Blonde", a Japanese-language version of "The Look That Kills" from her English-language album Cross My Palm. It sold 301,000 copies and added to her No.1 singles. Her most critically acclaimed single of that year was a heartfelt ballad called "Nanpasen," an emotionally draining song that many people attributed to her rocky relationship with her then-boyfriend, Masahiko Kondō and the death of Kondō's mother. It sold 431,000 copies and debuted at number 1.

She released only one album in 1987, an unsuccessful English debut album titled Cross My Palm. Reasons for its lack of success include Nakamori's heavily accented English and lack of promotion in the U.S. Nonetheless, it was a hit in Japan, selling 343,000 copies and debuting at number 1.

On March 3, 1988, Nakamori released album Stock. Three singles were released in 1988, "Al-Mauj", "Tattoo" and "I Missed the Shock." The first two debuted at No. 1.

In 1989, Nakamori only released one single due to her mental health at the time. "Liar" became her 20th No. 1 single. The single was rumored to reflect her feelings about Kondō. It came as a shock to the public when news of her attempted suicide in Kondō's apartment broke in July 1989, after he called off their engagement. She was found and hospitalized. After her physical recovery, she retreated from the public eye for a while.[8][9]
1990–1997[edit]

Her return to the music scene in 1990 was met with skepticism and curiosity, propelling the single "Dear Friend" to No. 1. Nakamori once claimed that Dear Friend is perhaps her only happy song. Nevertheless, she reverted to melancholic, jilted love songs that ultimately did not go well with the public's taste. Her next single "Mizu ni Sashita Hana" became her 21st Oricon #1 single, but she could not reach the top position again after that. In the autumn of 1990, she was slated to release a new studio album Gaze, which would include singles "Mizu ni Sashita Hana" and ten more songs written by writer Eikyo Kyo.[10][11] Due to issues with the record label, soon after her two-day live concert Yume, Nakamori left Warner Pioneer and the album remained unreleased.

In 1991 and 1992, Nakamori ventured into acting with varying success. Kome Kome Club's 1992 single Kimi ga Iru Dake de, which sold over 2.89 million copies, was the theme song of Japanese television drama Sugao no Mamade, in which she played a role.

In 1993, she transferred to the record company MCA Records and signed under the label MCA Victor.[12] On 21 May 1993, she released her 27th single "Everlasting Love", written and produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto. Two years had passed since the release of her previous single "Futari Shizuka: Tenkawa Densetsu Satsujin Jiken yori". According to the recording producer, Nakamori distanced herself from her casual style, and, along with her new music production staff, aimed more for a contemporary style with this release.[13] The single debuted at number 10 on the Oricon Weekly Single charts and charted for 5 weeks.

On 24 March 1994, Nakamori had a double release for her 28th single: her first cover single "Kataomoi", originally performed by Mie Nakao, and her first cover album Utahime. The double A-side track "Aibu" was written by Tetsuya Komuro. This track is widely popular among fans, and Nakamori has performed it very often during live tours.[14] Plans were made to release "Aibu" as a single, but it was decided that the start-up single would be "Everlasting Love." The single debuted at number 17 on the Oricon Weekly Single charts and charted for 8 weeks. The main producer of the cover album Utahime was Nakamori herself, and the main arranger was Akira Senju. The album debuted at number 5 on the Oricon Weekly Album Charts and charted for 9 weeks. In 2002, a re-mastered version of the album was released through Universal Music.

On 13 April 1994, Nakamori played a role as the first suspect on the TV Series Furuhata Ninzaburō in the episode titled "The Shoujo Manga Murderer".

On 2 September 1994, Nakamori released her 29th single "Yoru no Doko ka de (Night Shift)", written by Tsugutoshi Gotō. The single was promoted as the ending theme for Nippon Television Network System news program NNN Kyou Dekigoto and the B-side track Rose Bud was promoted as the ending theme for Fuji TV talk program Shingo to Shinsuke no Abunai Hanashi. The single debuted at number 14 on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts and charted for 7 weeks.

On 22 September 1993, Nakamori released her 15th studio album Unbalance+Balance. Four years had passed since the release of her previous studio album Cruise. The production of the album started in spring 1992 in the United States, before Nakamori moved to her new recording company. The album consists of two previously released singles' B-side tracks, "Not Crazy to Me" and "Aibu". Not Crazy to Me had a renewed arrangement. Two of the album tracks were written by Nakamori herself. The album tracks Eien no Tobira and Kagerou are melodically the same, however, they have completely different lyrics and themes. The idea was realized thanks to Nakamori's proposal to change the arrangement.[15] The album debuted at number 4 on the Oricon Weekly Album Charts and charted for 9 weeks. In 2002, through Universal Music, Nakamori released a re-mastered album with the renewed title Unbalance+Balance +6. This version of the album included six more additional tracks, singles, and their b-side tracks released between 1993 and 1994.

On 5 October 1994, she released her 30th single "Gekka" written by Shuugou Kajiwara. The single was promoted as a commercial song for Miki Corporation's Boutique Joy. In this single Nakamori returned to a more traditional melody, similar to her previous single Futari Shizuka, albeit with a more dramatic melody and difficult vibrato. The single debuted at number 8 on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts and charted for 7 weeks.

Between 1 and 5 December 1994, she held a special live titled Utahime Parco Theatre Live in the Parco Theatre. It was her first live show in two years. The set-list consists of songs from two previously released albums, Utahime and Unbalance+Balance with a small number of previously released hits. DVD footage of the performance was released on 24 March 1995.

On 21 June 1995, she released her 31st single "Genshi, Onna wa Taiyō Datta", written by Neko Oikawa. Akina stated she wanted to record a summer-like, up-tempo song because her previous singles were quiet ballads.[16] The single debuted at number 15 on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts and charted for 5 weeks.

On 21 July 1995, Nakamori released her 16th studio album La Alteración which included previously released singles with new arrangements. In Spanish, alteracion means change. As in her previous studio album, Nakamori was in charge of the main production of the album. The album jacket was shot in Morocco. The album debuted at number 7 on the Oricon Weekly Album Charts and charted for 8 weeks. In 2002, Nakamori released a re-mastered album with the renewed title La Alteración +4 through Universal Music. This version of the album included four more additional tracks, two singles, and the b-side tracks released in 1995.

On 1 November 1995, Nakamori released her 32nd single "Tokyo Rose", produced by Brian Setzer, who played guitar on the recording. It was her first single in the rockabilly genre. The single debuted at number 32 on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts and charted for 4 weeks.

On 6 December 1995, Nakamori released a compilation album True Album Akina 95 Best. It was her first compilation album released under the label, MCA Victor. The compilation album was divided into a 3-CD set: World Disc, Wild Disc, and Whisper Disc, with 7 tracks included on each CD. Nakamori was the main producer of the album. The album consisted of re-arranged hits released in the '80s and various singles and album tracks released during the first half of the '90s. Wild Disc included the new unreleased song Shangrilla, exclusively recorded for that album. The album debuted at number 16 on the Oricon Weekly Album Charts and charted for 7 weeks.

On 7 August 1996, Nakamori released her 33rd single "Moonlight Shadow: Tsuki ni Hoero" written by Toshihiko Takamizawa Tetsuya Komuro. It was Nakamori and Komuro's second collaboration since the single "Aibu". Komuro finished the composition around May and the recording in June.[18] The B-side did not include new songs, instead including a remixed version of the lead track. The single debuted at number 14 on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts and charted for 7 weeks.

On 18 December 1996, Nakamori released the mini album Vamp, her first mini-album since the release of mini-album Wonder in 1988. Nakamori was once again the album producer. The mini-album consisted of four songs that weren't included in any studio album and appeared only once before in the first press edition of the compilation album Utahime Densetsu: 90s Best. Before the album's release, she performed all four songs in her second dinner tour show 1996 Xmas Dinner Show, held between 5 and 26 December. The album debuted at number 30 on the Oricon Weekly Album Charts and charted for 5 weeks.

On 21 February 1997, she released her 34th single "Appetite", written by Seriko Natsuno and U-ki. It was released as the lead single to her upcoming studio album. For Nakamori, it was one of the most difficult melodies to practice.[19] The single debuted at number 46 on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts and charted for 4 weeks.

On 21 March 1997, Nakamori released her 17th studio album Shaker. Nakamori was once again the album producer. The album consisted of two previously released singles with new arrangements. In the newspaper Asahi Shinbun, Nakamori explained that the album's melody crosses from digital into acoustic sounds and that she had carefully chosen songs that she could sing in her key.[20] The album debuted at number 14 on the Oricon Weekly Album Charts and charted for 5 weeks. It was her final release under the MCA Victor label. In 2002, a re-mastered album with the renewed title Shaker +3 was released under Universal Music. This version of the album included three additional tracks, singles with the original arrangement, and one b-side track. Between 3 May and 21 June 1997, she held a live tour titled Felicidad, her first tour in almost 9 years. The DVD footage was released on 22 September 1997 through Universal Music. After the tour, she officially left MCA Records.
1998–1999[edit]

In 1998, Nakamori moved to the Gauss Entertainment record label. In January, she played a main role in the Japanese television drama Tsumetai Tsuki.[21] It was her first main role since Sugao no Mama de. She also performed the theme song "Kisei (Never Forget)", written by Yasuhiro Suzu. The single was released on 11 February. Nakamori stated that the balance between low and high pitches was difficult for her to sing. The single debuted at 19 on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts and sold 94k copies. The B-side track was a remastered version of the previous album track Tsuki ga Aoku, which was released on the studio album Shaker.[22]

On 21 May 1998, Nakamori released her thirty-sixth single "Kon'ya, Nagareboshi", written by Keiko Utsumi. The single debuted at number 66 on the Oricon Single Weekly Charts. The B-side track Arashi no Nakade was written by the Russian singer Origa. It was one of her worst-selling singles throughout her two-decade career.

On 17 June 1998, Nakamori released her eighteenth studio album Spoon. The album included two previously released promotional singles. Five out of eleven songs were arranged by Ikurō Fujiwara. In the album booklet, Nakamori is credited as the main producer of the album.[23] The album debuted at number 17 on the Oricon Weekly Album Charts and charted for three weeks. Between 21 June and 17 July, Akina held the national live tour Spoon Tour.[24][25] The video footage was never released on DVD as of 2019.

On 23 September 1998, she released her 37th single "Tomadoi" written by Juni. "Tomadoi" was selected as the theme song for the Japanese television drama 39Sai no Aki.

The single debuted at number forty on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts.

On 3 and 4 November 1998, she held a special live show Symphonic Concert '98 with Symphonic A Orchestra.

In January 1999, Nakamori played a main role in the television drama Border Hanzai Shinri Sōsa File. She also performed the theme song "Ophelia", written by Shimano Satoshi, which was released as a single on 21 January 1999. The title "Ophelia" comes from Shakespeares's famous play Hamlet. In this single, Nakamori tried to interpret the character Ofelia's sadness in lyrics; however, she also wanted to sing to all people who were suffering from pain and sadness.[26] The B-Side track was an alternative version of Ofelia under the title To Be, which was sung in English. The single debuted at number 29 on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts and charted for 8 weeks.

The chief of the Gauss Entertainment recording label, Kazuhiro Chiba, caused issues throughout Nakamori's stay with the label: in late 1998, it was announced that a special birthday event would be held in July 1999, however, this was canceled without warning and the 8000-yen refund took about one year. In early December, at a special press conference, Chiba stated that Nakamori was a "troublemaker, who shouldn't exist in the music industry." The cancellation of her contract was announced at the end of the press conference. The cancellation was to take place in December.[27][28][29]

On 21 December 1999, Nakamori's final single with Gauss Entertainment, "Trust Me" (written by Kazuhiro Hara) and her 19th studio album, Will, were released. "Trust Me" debuted at number 57 on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts. It is Akina's worst-selling single as of 2019. The B-side track Yuki no Hana, subtitled White X'mas, was a rearranged version of a previously released studio album track. Some fans regard the studio album Will as a compilation album from the Gauss label. It included two previously released singles and remixes of previously released album tracks and Gauss singles. The album track Tsuki no Hohoemi was chosen as a theme song for the video game series Wizardry. The original soundtrack of Wizardry Digmuil included the acoustic and orchestral versions of this song, both written by Fujiwara. The album had only three new songs. On Nakamori's official website, the album is not even listed in the list of original studio albums. The album was produced by Gauss's director, Kazuhiro Chiba. The album debuted at number 52 on the Oricon Weekly Album charts and charted for one week.
2000–2010[edit]

In 2000, Nakamori signed a temporary contract with the music production company Koubouraku and established a private office called Faith (nowadays known as a Nakamori fan club, Faithway).[30] Between 18 May and 27 June 2000, she held a national acoustic tour Akina Nakamori 2000: 21 Seiki he. It was her first national tour in two years. Video footage of the tour was included in the limited edition version of her compilation album All Time Best: Original, released in 2014.

On 31 May 2001, Nakamori released the single "It's Brand New Day", written by Adya.

Nakamori switched management from Koubouroku to the private office Faith, and transferred to her current record label, Universal Music.[33] To celebrate her first release under her new recording company, she released a cover album titled Zero Album: Utahime 2 on 20 March 2002. In the album booklet, she was credited as the album's main producer.[34] The album debuted at number 10 on the Oricon Weekly Album Charts. It was her first album to debut in the top 10 on the Oricon Charts since her 1995 studio album La Alteración.[35][36]

On 2 May 2002, Nakamori released her forty-first single "The Heat (Musica Fiesta)", written by Adya. It was also her first release under Universal Music. The B-side tracks were included in her studio album as instrumental recordings. In the media, the single was selected as the May ending theme for the TBS program Wonderful. The single debuted at number 20 on the Oricon Weekly Single Charts.

Three weeks later on 22 May 2002, Nakamori released her 20th studio album Resonancia. It was her first album released under Universal Music and her first album in three years. In Spanish, "resonancia" means "sound."[37] The main instrumental concept of the album was an R&B and Latin rhythm feeling.[38] Uru is credited as the main producer of the album in the album booklet.

On 14 May 2003, Nakamori released her 21st studio album I Hope So.

After a five-year hiatus, Nakamori opened a new Twitter account and official website on August 30, 2022. She announced that she transferred her management from Faith to a new label called HZ Village; she also stated that her physical condition is not ideal yet.[97][98][99] On 28 April 2023, Japanese cinemas screened a 4K remastered version of her live session "East Live Index" for a limited period of time. At the end of the footage, there was a recorded voice-only message from Nakamori, the first time in several years that her real voice was heard.[100][101] After stepping away from her singing activities, Nakamori made her appearance on Tetsuji Hayashi's tribute album 50th Anniversary Special A Tribute of Hayashi Tetsuji: Saudade, in which she re-recorded her 1984 single "Kita Wing" in an orchestral pop rendition, and was released on 8 November 2023.[102][103] Coinciding with the album's release, it would be the first time in six years that she released new music. In December 2023, she made a message to the listeners during the 4-hour radio special Nakamori Akina All Time Request which was aired on the Nippon Broadcasting System.

Humanitarian ventures[edit]

In 1998, Nakamori, alongside José Carreras and Andy Lau among others, participated during the Food Aid Concert charity concert on 17 October.[112] The proceeds from the concert and the subsequent gala dinner went to feed for the North Korean children.[113]

In December 2023, Nakamori participated in a charity auction where she auctioned her hat that was used in her 2023 photoshoot. The proceeds from the auction were given to the non-profit organization Positive Living through AIDS Orphan Support (abbreviated as PLAS) to help African orphans with AIDS.[114][115][116]
Personal life[edit]

In 1984, during the filming of the movie Ai Tabidachi, it has been slowly known to the public the relationship between Nakamori and fellow singer-actor Masahiko Kondo.[117] Their relationship has been approved by her family and Kondo himself visited her family many times while they were dating.[118] In July 1989, Nakamori attempted suicide at Kondo's apartment. Sustained with a deep wound on her wrist, she was immediately hospitalized. The incident prompted Nakamori to temporarily step away from the public eye.[118] Some journalists believed that her rival, Seiko Matsuda and Kondo were spotted together on the tabloid magazine Friday which it could have been one of the reasons why Nakamori attempted suicide.[119] However, in December, 5 months after the incident, during a press conference, Kondo stated that they have never been in the relationship.[118]

In 1987, Nakamori's sister, Akiho made her acting debut as an actress in a television drama.[120] A year later in 1988, she published her first and only photo-book and adult-video album.[121][122] Due to their facial similarities and carrying the same surname, there were some people who believed that it was actually Akina, not knowing it was actually her sister.[120] However, her career was not successful and within the few years, she had retired from acting and did not made any public appearances since then.[120] In 2019, when Akiho died, it has been reported that Nakamori herself did not appear on the funeral.[123]

In 1988, Nakamori's mother, Chieko was diagnosed with rectal cancer for the first time.[124] Despite surgical and recovery efforts, her mother eventually passed away in 1995.[124] During that time, Nakamori did not appear on her mother's funeral. This led to distance her relationship and contact with her family.[125][126]

In an interview on the music television program Yoru no Hit Studio in 1989, singer and former idol Kyoko Koizumi shared how Nakamori aided her after she was egged during the Shinjuku Music Festival, describing her as "a very kind and considerate person, which is rare to find in the entertainment industry".[127] The incident became one of the moments in which their friendship had begun to develop.[128]

In 2023, while Nakamori was delivering her message during Nippon Broadcasting System's Nakamori Akina All Time Request radio special, she stated that she is currently single.[104]
Artistry[edit] Influences[edit]

Nakamori has been cited by many Instagram influencers in their teens and 20s,[129][130] idols, and musicians as their main influence in music and fashion. Speaking to Billboard Japan in 2012, singer-songwriter Leo Ieiri cites Nakamori, alongside Momoe Yamaguchi and Princess Princess, as the artists whom she loved since elementary school due to their mature lyrics and melodies.[131] She also stated in 2018 that she owns a DVD collection of Nakamori's appearances in The Best Ten and she's taking inspiration from it.[132] In a 2023 interview, singer and actress Yoko Minamino admittedly said that she took fashion inspirations from Nakamori during her debuting period as an idol.[133] Voice actress and singer Sora Amamiya shared that she was inspired by Nakamori's songs while in the process of songwriting for her 2022 compilation album and subsequently for her 2023 EP.[134][135] Contemporary kayokyoku singer Kawai Fujii listed Nakamori's "Shōjo A" and "Nanpasen" as one of her personal favorite songs, which she performed for a campaign.[136] Musician Miya of Mucc and Petit Brabancon cited Nakamori as the only pop artist he ever listens to, albeit not a fan of pop music in general.[137]
Legacy[edit]

Nakamori was honored by the Japanese Music Critics as the 5th best voice in the country's recording history, even ahead of her rival, Seiko Matsuda, who was honored at 7th place.[citation needed] According to the Oricon Charts, she is one of a handful of singers who managed to have albums in the Top 10 in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. HMV Japan ranked her No. 55 Top Japanese Artist of All Time,[138]

As of 2011, Nakamori has sold over 25.3 million records was named the third best-selling female Japanese idol singer of all time.[139][140]
